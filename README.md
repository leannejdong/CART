# CART implementation

Simple Classification-and-Regression-Tree Algorithm From Scratch in C++. 
(Base on Jason Brownlee's Python [codes](https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-decision-tree-algorithm-scratch-python/))

* What is CART?

CART is the most classical decision tree algorithm. It starts with a top-down greedy splitting, and greedy going back and print.

* Compiler requirement

 * gcc10 (preferred)

 * clang10 (concepts library and constraint auto unavailable)

 * MSVC19.23
